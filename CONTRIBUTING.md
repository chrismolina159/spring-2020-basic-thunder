### Pushing and Pulling Code Process:
1. Ensure that your local code is up to date with the repo
2. Do not push if you are not finished with your code.  Finished meaning that everything has been tested, and the code is ready to be looked at by another developer or has been double-checked and is ready to go live.
3. Do not include in your commit messages that your code is ready to be double-checked.  This can be sent in a Slack message
4. Write meaningful commit messages without including your name/account in the message.

### Workflow:
We will be using separate branches instead of having each developer work on the master branch.  The master branch should only accept working, double-checked code or items that don't need changed(i.e. image files).
The workflow for this project will follow a "feature branch" version control workflow outlined [here](https://knowledge.kitchen/Feature_branch_version_control_workflow).  Each component/view that is currently being worked on, should have its own branch with an appropiate name.  Once the developer believes their code is finished, they should issue a pull request to the master branch.  The reviewing developer can then accept the pull request or reject with comments as to why the code was rejected.

### Team norms:
1. It's normal to have disagreements in a team, but everyone must remain respectful to one another at all times.  No harassment, spamming, or racial remarks will be tolerated on team basic thunder.
2. All messages regarding the project needs to be sent in the Slack channel.
3. If code is ready to be double-checked, message the Slack channel with a brief description of which file(s) should be looked at and what changes were made. Only **ONE** person needs to double-check, so if you can/cannot check another developer's code, reply to that developer. Do not read requests and ignore them hoping someone else will do the work.  This lets all developers know who isn't available and avoids multiple people doing the same work.
4. When you reply to someone's request, give a timeframe of when you are going to fufill this request.  This avoids having developers in limbo without knowing when things might be completed.
5. Meeting times and location: Tuesdays & Thursdays at 12:15p.m. in the first floor of Courant and Saturdays 3:00p.m. at Bobst 1st floor.
6. If a student continuously breaks any rules outlined in this file, misses meetings/is late, or is not doing enough work as decided by the group, then the **GROUP** will decide to give a warning to this student.  If a student's behavior continues after this warning, then the group minus said student will vote on reporting to the professor.  If the group is deciding on multiple students, then there will be multiple votes.  Three is still the number for majority votes, and in the event of a tie, the student will remain on their warning.  None of this should be documented on Slack, because this is for the student and team's improvement.  Having these messages on Slack can be a negative reminder of some mistakes that have been addressed.

### Meetings:
1. Scrum master needs to be stern but respectful in keeping meetings flowing on track, and everyone must respect when the scrum master trys to restablish normal flow.
2. Scrum master is in charge of uploading meeting notes to Slack.
3. In the meeting notes, include a brief overview of the topics discussed in the meeting, task progress, and what will be discussed in the next meeting.
4. All team members can bring up a topic and are encouraged to do so.  However, do not switch from topic to topic without having fully agreed within the team that the previous topic has been answered.
5. All decisions, unless decided to be considered trivial, should be voted on.  Whenever three votes are given in favor or out favor, voting is concluded.  If you don't have an opinion on a decision, say so to remove your vote, however, you may be forced to choose in the event of a tie.
