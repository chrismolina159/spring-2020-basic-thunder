# Biazza

## Project Description
__Biazza__ is a forum style web application that provides an efficient mean for Professor-Student communication. Examples of similar forums can be Piazza, Campuswire, NYUClasses forum.

The application aims to help Professors to clarify course related contents that students do not really understand and to help student who share similar questions to brought up their questions to the Professor's attention.

From the perspective of the end-user, there are two types of user roles. Namely, instructor and student. The instructor is able to create a course forum, invite students, view all the questions raised by students, reply to posts or mark the answers from students as official answers. The student can participate in a class by post questions to class forum, reply to an existing question, endorse useful answers as well as unendorsed not-so-useful answers.

## History of Project
The Biazza project was originally proposed by Jiaqi Liu and Lingyi Ju. Inspired by the easy-to-use forums such as Stack Overflow, Piazza, and Campuswire, Jiaqi and Lingyu sought an opportunity to provide realize a full-stack web application that integrates the characteristics of the above user-friendly forums.

Basic Thunder is the team that is responsible for realizing the Biazza proposal. This team is formed by a group of bright students in the Agile _Software Development and DevOps_ course at NYU.
